# Memory: RealCUGAN Qt Multimedia Pipeline Verification

Verified that `RealCuganProcessor` mirrors `RealEsrganProcessor` by using `QMediaPlayer` and `QVideoSink` for direct frame decoding and processing. Key constructor lines:

- Creation of QMediaPlayer and QVideoSink with connections for frame capture and error handling.
- Video processing method sets the media source, starts encoding after frames are read.

This confirms a consistent Qt Multimediaâ€“driven pipeline across both processors.
