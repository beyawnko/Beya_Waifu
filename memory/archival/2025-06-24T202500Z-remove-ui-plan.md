# Removal of obsolete UI repair plan

**Date:** 2025-06-24T20:25:00Z
**Summary:** The empty placeholder file `UI_REPAIR_PLAN_PART2.md` was removed because all layout updates were already implemented, as documented in [2025-06-22T034841Z-setClass-fix-layout-analysis.md](2025-06-22T034841Z-setClass-fix-layout-analysis.md). A note was added to that memory entry explaining the removal.
