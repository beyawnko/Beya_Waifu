# Qt6 + C++17 QA Review

## Summary
Performed a read-only review of the repository to assess utilization of Qt6 features and modern C++17 techniques. The project targets Qt6 (see README.md lines 1-3) and compiles with C++17 per `Waifu2x-Extension-QT.pro` (CONFIG += c++17). Video decoding uses `QMediaPlayer` and `QVideoSink`.

Areas for improvement:
1. `tools/run_cppcheck.sh` enforces `--std=c++11`, which conflicts with C++17.
2. Build system relies on qmake; Qt6 recommends CMake for better IDE and tooling integration.
3. `LiquidGlassWidget` uses `QOpenGLWidget` and raw OpenGL; consider migrating to Qt6 RHI with shaders compiled via Qt Shader Tools.
4. Asynchronous pipelines depend on `QtConcurrent::run` without using the modern `QFuture::then`/`QPromise` APIs for chaining tasks.
5. Frame processing converts `QVideoFrame` to `QImage` via `toImage()`, which incurs a copy and CPU overhead.
6. Repository includes `.pro.user` files referencing Qt 5.15, which are environment-specific and outdated.
