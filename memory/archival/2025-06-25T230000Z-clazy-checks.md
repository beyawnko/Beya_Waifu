# Integrate clazy static analysis

Added a new clazy-based code check alongside cppcheck. The `tools/run_clazy.sh` script builds the Qt application with clang under `bear` to capture compilation commands and then runs `clazy-standalone`. A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow executes the script and uploads `clazy.log`.
