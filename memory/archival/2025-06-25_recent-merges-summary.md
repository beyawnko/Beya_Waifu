# Task Summary: Recent Merge Fixes for File Lists and Linker Error

**Date:** 2025-06-25
**Agent:** Beya Waifu

## Overview
Recent pull requests merged into `main` address stability problems in the file-list handling code and solve a linker error that blocked builds. Pull requests **#304** through **#307** incrementally fixed crashes, table population, and column mismatches. Pull request **#303** resolved the `Read_Input_paths_BrowserFile` linker issue.

## Key Commits
- `3a4b2fd` – initial fix for file list crashes and proper population.
- `50ef0af` – refined insertion functions and prevented crashes on empty lists.
- `f610e8e` – corrected column counts and added tracing.
- `e9f2250` – final merge of file list fixes.
- `2e999a1` – added missing definition for `Read_Input_paths_BrowserFile`.

## Outcome
All merges built successfully on the sandbox. The file list UI now populates correctly without crashes, and the linker error is gone. Remaining open issues listed in [[memory/archival/2025-06-21T093153Z-current-project-status.md]] are unaffected, but these merges improve overall stability.
