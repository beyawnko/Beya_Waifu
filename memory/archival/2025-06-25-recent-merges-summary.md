# Task Summary: Recent Merge Fixes for File Lists and Linker Error

**Date:** 2025-06-25
**Agent:** Beya Waifu

## Overview
Recent pull requests merged into `main` address stability problems in the file-list handling code and solve a linker error that blocked builds. Pull requests **#304** through **#307** incrementally fixed crashes, table population, and column mismatches. Pull request **#303** resolved the `Read_Input_paths_BrowserFile` linker issue. Files added via the Browse button now appear correctly and debug traces confirm row and column counts.

## Key Commits
- `3a4b2fd` implemented `Batch_Table_Update_slots` and fixed crashes when removing items.
- `50ef0af` refined insertion functions and added null checks.
- `8e64501` introduced extensive debug logging for table updates.
- `f610e8e` corrected column counts and added early startup logs.
- `e9f2250` final merge of file list fixes.
- `2e999a1` added missing definition for `Read_Input_paths_BrowserFile`.
- Merge commits `827e6cf`, `b96f7b3`, and `16bb70c` integrated these fixes.

## Outcome
All merges built successfully on the sandbox. The UI table now populates correctly without crashes, and the linker error is gone. Remaining open issues listed in [[memory/archival/2025-06-21T093153Z-current-project-status.md]] are unaffected, but overall stability is improved.
