# Known Issues and Upcoming Tasks

## Summary
- Recent merges fixed various build errors, but Qt's uic still generates invalid `setClass`/`setCssClass` calls in `ui_mainwindow.h`. Only some buttons have been patched.
- C++ references to removed widgets were commented out to compile, but a cleaner solution is needed.
- Windows build script now downloads Vulkan SDK directly, but environment setup must still be verified on fresh systems.
- TODO.md lists pending tasks for `.git/hooks/sendemail-validate.sample` and `stb_image.h` placeholders.

## Next Steps
- Implement a robust method to patch or avoid `setClass` properties across all buttons.
- Refactor code to fully remove obsolete widget references and ensure cross-platform builds pass.
- Convert TODO.md entries into actionable GitHub issues or track them in project planning.
