# Documentation and Test Skip Improvements

## Summary
- Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing how to clone the repo, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run `pytest`.
- Linked the new guide from the `README.md` tests section.
- Added `tests/__init__.py` with a warning when `PySide6` is missing and exposing `PYSIDE6_AVAILABLE`.
- Updated all GUI-related tests to skip gracefully if `PySide6` is unavailable.
- Verified by installing requirements and running `pytest` (21 passed, 42 skipped).
